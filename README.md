# Metropolis
Optimizing Portfolio via Metropolis Algorithm 

Functions.h file includes functions that will be utilized, such as functions for multiplying matrices and other handy linear functions. 

Metropolis.cpp takes in a covariance matrix of 50 different companies found in V.txt and finds the minimum variance portfolio using
Metropolis where both long and short positions are allowed. It compares this to the actual minimum variance portfolio.

MetropolisNoShort.cpp does the same thing as the Metropolis.cpp file except it does not allow for short positions.
